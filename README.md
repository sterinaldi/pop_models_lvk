# pop_models_lvk
My implementation of (some) LVK population models – see Appendix of [this paper](https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.011048)

Install this package with `pip install .` (or `pip install -e .` for editable mode).
Currently there's only one module available, `population_models.mass`: some more will come in the future, and pull requests with implementations are welcome!
